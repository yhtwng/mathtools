some cool tools for maths using :)

that's my first using of python on github so yeah! :) feel free to use everything as u want, i hope it will be useful (if u want, u can credit me, i appreciate that, but that's fine if u do not lol)
so first i posted a tool to inverse matrice with gauss' pivot, and also an another tool to get the "squareroot" of a complex number (sadly, the answer is in decimals so it will just be useful to understand the
algorithm of getting the squareroot of a complex, to check your answer or to do some fun tricks with it!!)
so if u want to give me some advices, i really appreciate your opinion on what i did

thank u so much for reading (idk if someone is going to read this lmao) ^^
