some cool tools for maths use :)

that's my first try of python on github! :) feel free to use everything as u want, i hope it will be useful.

*so first i posted a tool to inverse matrix with gauss' pivot, and also an another tool to get the "squareroot" of a complex number (sadly, the answer is in decimals so it will just be useful to understand the
algorithm of getting the squareroot of a complex, to check your answer or to do some fun tricks with it!!)*

so if u want to give me some advices, i really appreciate your opinion on what i did

thank u so much for reading (idk if someone is going to read this lmao) ^^
